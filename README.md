# OPENLXP-XIS - Experience Index Service 
The primary funnel for learning experience metadata collected by the Experience Indexing Agent (XIA) components.

XIS Component is the primary funnel for learning experience metadata collected by the XIA components. In addition, the XIS can receive supplemental learning experience metadata – field name/value overrides and augmentations – from the [Experience Management Service (XMS)](https://github.com/adlnet/ecc-openlxp-xms).

Learning experience metadata received from XIAs is stored in the Metadata Loading Area and processed asynchronously to enhance overall system performance and scalability. Processed metadata combined with supplemental metadata provided by an Experience Owner or Experience Manager and the "composite record" stored in the Metadata Repository. Metadata Repository records addition/modification events logged to a job queue, and the metadata is then sent to the Experience Search Engine (XSE) for indexing and high-performance location/retrieval.

XIS can syndicate its composite records to another XIS. One or more facets/dimensions can filter the record-set to transmit a subset of the overall composite record repository. In addition, the transmitted fieldset can be configured to contain redacted values for specified fields when information is considered too sensitive for syndication.

## Workflows
### ETL
ETL pipeline from XIA loads processed metadata ledger and supplemental ledger in a metadata ledger and supplemental ledger of XIS component after a validation. Metadata combined with supplemental metadata provided by an Experience Owner or Experience Manager from XMS also gets stored in XIS. All of them from XIA and XMS finally get merged into XIS's composite ledger after a validation.  

Composite metadata is then sent to an XSE for further discovery.

### Upstream Syndication
Upstream Syndication allows for connecting the current XIS to another XIS in order to retrieve experiences.  Running the Upstream Syndication workflow, triggers a task to iterate over all XIS Upstream configurations that have an active status.  The task retrieves all Composite Ledger experiences from the remote XIS and attempts to load them into the local Metadata and Supplemental Ledgers.  If the incoming data doesn't match the locally set schema, or would otherwise fail being uploaded, it isn't saved.

### Downstream Syndication
Downstream Syndication allows for connecting the current XIS to another XIS in order to send experiences.  Running the Downstream Syndication workflow, triggers a task to iterate over all XIS Downstream configurations that have an active status.  The task retrieves all Composite Ledger experiences from the local XIS and performs any filters on the records and metadata.  It then attempts to load them into the remote's Metadata and Supplemental Ledgers using the managed-data API.  If the outgoing data doesn't match the remote schema, or would otherwise fail being uploaded, it will not be saved.

## Running Of XIS Tasks:

### Running Tasks
XIS has 3 workflows that can be run.  Consolidation and loading of Metadata and Supplemental Metadata into Compositing Ledger then loading it into XSE.  XIS Upstream Syndication.  And XIS Downstream Syndication.  They can each be triggered 2 ways:

1. Through API Endpoints:
    - For consolidating records to the Composite Ledger and loading it into XSE:
        ```
        http://localhost:8080/api/xis-workflow
        ```

    - For Upstream Syndication:
        ```
        http://localhost:8080/api/upstream-workflow
        ```

    - For Downstream Syndication:
        ```
        http://localhost:8080/api/downstream-workflow
        ```

2. Periodically through celery beat: 

    On the Django admin page, click `Periodic tasks` >  `Add periodic task`. Here you can schedule celery beat to periodically run the workflows for you. To do so, enter the configurations below:
        - `Name` - Short description for this task
        - `Task (registered)`: The workflow to run from the Task (registered) dropdown list.  On the selected time interval celery task will run the task.

## Removing Deployment
To destroy the created resources, simply run the command below in your terminal:
    
    
    docker compose down

## API's 

XIS supports API's endpoints which can get called from other components

1. `/api/catalogs/`
    
    This API fetches the names of all course providers in the composite ledger

2. `/api/metadata/`
    
    This API is for uploading metadata ledger records

3. `/api/supplemental-data/`
    
    This API is for uploading supplemental ledger records

4. `/api/metadata/<str:course_id>/`
    
    This API fetches the composite ledger object

5. `/api/managed-data/catalogs/`
    
    This API fetches the names of all course providers in the metadata ledger

6. `/api/managed-data/catalogs/<str:provider_id>`
    
    This API fetches the metadata and supplemental ledger data under a specific catalog/course provider

7. `/api/managed-data/catalogs/<str:provider_id>/<str:course_id>/`
    
    This API fetches or modifies the record of the corresponding course id

## Logs
To check the running of celery tasks, check the logs of application and celery container.


## Troubleshooting
- If the container builds but crashes or logs an error of unrecognized commands, the issue is usually incorrect line endings. Most IDEs/Text Editors allow changing the line endings, but the dos2unix utility can also be used to change the line endings of `start-app.sh` and `start-server.sh` to LF.


- A good basic troubleshooting step is to use `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the app image; however, this will delete everything in the database.
